# **BisiPortfolio**

## **Overview**

Machine Learning Engineer specialized in **LLMs, multimodal learning, and robotics-oriented AI systems**.
I build fine-tuning and evaluation pipelines for large models, automation frameworks for data and model ops, and rapid prototypes that turn research into functional products.
Recent work includes edge-based perception systems, multi-agent reasoning, and language-conditioned control. Passionate about making AI systems that reason, act, and recover under real-world constraints.

## **Work Experience**

### **ML Engineer — Simplex Rapid (11/2024 - 10/2025, Milan)**

I integrated LLM and AI systems into precision-mechanics workflows from model selection and domain adaptation to deployment, observability, and cost/latency tuning. I led a multilingual translation pipeline with fine-tuned models across **20 languages**, reaching a **~53% touchless rate**; this cut total human effort from **~8,000 hours** to **~2,350 hours** (about **71% less**) for the same volume and produced an estimated **~76% cost reduction** for linguistic work. I migrated an agentic business assistant to the Responses API with tool calling, monitoring, and tracing for reliable operations, and I built an LLM+vision extraction flow that reads spring drawings and PDFs with per-field validation and human-in-the-loop review to auto-populate manufacturing parameters.

## **Selected Projects**

### **Embedded Vision Trade-offs on Arduino Nicla Vision**

The project exposes the real trade-offs between accuracy, latency, RAM, and Flash on the Arduino Nicla Vision by coupling firmware-level measurements with protocol-driven evaluation. It demonstrates why accuracy-only comparisons are misleading on embedded targets and provides a systematic methodology to surface activation peaks, memory bottlenecks, and deployment instability through end-to-end, hardware-in-the-loop experimentation.

**Focus:** Reproducible, on-device benchmarking of image classification models under strict microcontroller constraints.

### **MuseINO (Tiny Hack Torino, Italian Tech Week 2025)**

Developed an edge-based “Instagram for museums” using Arduino Nicla Vision to measure visitor attention without recording video. The prototype quantifies dwell time and engagement while preserving privacy. Built the full MVP in ~24 hours and iterated for 32.

**Focus:** Embedded AI, perception-to-signal design, privacy-safe metrics.
**Repository:** [MuseINO](https://github.com/Blackhand01/TinyHack2025)

### **Multi-Agent Advisor System (ETH AI Center - UBS track, Swiss AI Weeks 2025)**

Co-built a multi AI agent dialog-to-action prototype for financial advisory tasks with Apertus-8B and GPT-4o as LLMs. Two lightweight models classify client–advisor intents, while a “judge” model arbitrates disagreements and triggers human fallback.

**Focus:** Safe tool-use, confidence arbitration, agentic reasoning.
**Repository:** [MAAS](https://github.com/Blackhand01/ZurichHackathon2025)

### **OnlyFly (HackUPC 2025)**

🏆 **4th place out of 150+ international teams (Skyscanner Challenge)**
Built an AI-powered home-exchange platform that matches travelers based on preferences and optimizes trip costs using Skyscanner and Revolut APIs. Delivered a functional MVP in 36 hours.

**Focus:** Recommender systems, backend reliability, sustainable AI design.
**Repository:** [OnlyFly](https://github.com/Blackhand01/HackUPC-Spring2025)

### **PostGenius (GenAI.Works 2024)**

🏆 **7th place out of 4,500 participants**
Created a **RAG-based multimedia generator** that turns news into contextual posts, images, and videos using FastAPI and OpenAI/Vectara APIs. Designed for social media and newsroom automation.

**Focus:** Retrieval Augmented Generation, grounding, hallucination control.
**Repository:** [PostGenius](https://github.com/Blackhand01/PostGenius)

### **Vision Transformer (ViT) Implementation**

Re-implemented and optimized ViT on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, achieving benchmark-level accuracy and demonstrating superior scalability over CNN baselines.
**Repository:** [ViT](https://github.com/Blackhand01/Vision-Transformer)

### **BisiAgent007**

A personal LLM-powered coding assistant with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, semantic code search, and auto-edit features inspired by Cursor.
**Repository:** [BisiAgent007](https://github.com/Blackhand01/BisiAgent007)
